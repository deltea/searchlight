# :flashlight: Searchlight (Not finished)

Lighthouse, Inspired by [Hidden Folks](https://hiddenfolks.com/) in an exhibit of independent video games at [MoPop (Seattle)](https://www.mopop.org/)

**Live Demo:** [thcheetah777.github.io/searchlight](https://thcheetah777.github.io/searchlight/)

## Description

Lighthouse is a bird's-eye view video game. The player has to track down the listed targets in the dark, with only a short-range flashlight. The player can eat powerups to make his flashlight range wider. The player can also chop down trees to look behind them.
