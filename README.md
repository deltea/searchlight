Lighthouse, Inspired by a exhibit of independent video games at [MoPop (Seattle)](https://www.mopop.org/)

## Description

Lighthouse is a bird's-eye view video game. The player has to track down of the listed targets in the dark, with only a short range flashlight. The player can eat powerups to make his flashlight range wider. The player can also chop down trees to look behind them.
